Simple game where you should collect coins and avoid killer UFOs.
Your score is calculated based on how many coins you collect, how many UFOs you destroy and how long you manage to stay alive.
The game is controlled using the arrow keys, spacebar to shoot, p to pause and r to reset the game.

To run the game, compile the game using:
javac CopterFight.java
and run it with:
java CopterFight
NOTE:
To compile the game from source, you also need JavaGameUtils (https://github.com/Jonhoo/JavaGameUtils) and JavaMediaUtils (https://github.com/Jonhoo/JavaMediaUtils)
These are included with the zip file this game is normally distributed as, but if you get odd import errors, those are probably missing.

Alternately, just double click CopterFight.jar, which has everything precompiled.

The game was developed for the course 2D and 3D Games Programming at Bond University, QLD, Australia by Jon Gjengset <jon@thesquareplanet.com> in early 2011.
