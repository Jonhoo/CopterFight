Simple game where you should collect coins and avoid killer UFOs.
Your score is calculated based on how many coins you collect, how many UFOs you destroy and how long you manage to stay alive.
The game is controlled using the arrow keys, spacebar to shoot, p to pause and r to reset the game.

To run the game, compile the game using:
javac CopterFight.java
and run it with:
java CopterFight
NOTE:
